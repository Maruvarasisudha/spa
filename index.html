<p>
    <ul class="fs-5"><li>A SPA application is a single page that continuously interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the
     current page rather than loading entire new pages from a server. 
     Trello, Facebook, Gmail, and Twitter are a few single page app examples.</li>
    </ul>

<h3 class="mb-5">Single Page Application Benefits:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Single-page applications are fast as most of the resources, including HTML, CSS, and Scripts, are loaded once, and only data is transmitted back and forth.
     Here are some of the business benefits of building single-page applications:</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p class="fs-4 mt-5"> Quick Loading Time:</p>

   A page taking over 200 milliseconds to load can significantly affect your online business and, eventually, sales.

With the SPA approach, your full page loads quicker than traditional web applications, as it only has to load a page at the first request. On the other hand, traditional web apps have to load pages at every request, taking more time.
</li>
<li><p class="fs-4 mt-2"> Seamless User: </p>
SPAs deliver an experience like a desktop or mobile app. 
Users do not have to watch a new page load, as only the content changes and not the page, 
making the experience an enjoyable one.</li>

<li><p class="fs-4"> Ease in Building Feature-rich Apps:</p>
SPA application makes it easy to add advanced features to a web application.
 For example, it is easier to build a content editing web app with real-time analysis using SPA development.
 Doing this with a traditional web app requires a total page reload to perform content analysis.</li>

<li><p class="fs-4">Uses Less Bandwidth:</p>
It is no surprise that SPAs consume less bandwidth since they only load web pages once. 
Besides that, they can also do well in areas with a slow internet connection.
 Hence, it is convenient for everyone to use, regardless of internet speed.</li>
